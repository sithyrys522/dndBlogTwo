# My DND Blog Version Two

Welcome to the blog of The Blue Knight's Adventures! This Github repo is for my internal use of developing the blog while simulatenously learning web development.

Through the use of the [wiki](https://github.com/sithyrys522/dndBlogTwo/wiki) and issues tracker I will hopefully be keeping decent documentation of my learning path to refer back to if I need to.

The site can be found [here](www.treasuresofavileia.com)

## Tech

### Current Tech Stack

- NodeJS (Server)
- ExpressJS (Server)
- EJS (View-Engine)
- Mongoose and local MongoDB Server

### Planned additions as I learn

- Heroku or DO when I push this version live
- Something to automate deployment because I'm lazy (likely to be a lot of git hooks)
- Something to aid in documenting this so I don't forget anything (For now, the built in wiki of the repo and tons of issues in the tracker)

    <h2>Melody</h2>
    <p>I am a 28 year old half-drow/high elf mix, although I am very reluctant to express my full heritage to strangers. Most just recognize me as a half-drow and keep their distance when walking by. I stand at a solid 5’8” with midnight black, thin straight hair that lands just above halfway down my back. My ears are slightly pointed and both the sclera (white part) and iris of my eyes are a deep red leaving just the black pupils in the middle. I am thin and toned from traveling for the past few years of my life on foot or horseback, but certainly far from strong physically. My daily outfit is a black dress with gold trimming that stretches across my collarbones and shoulders, opens up to reveal the top of my chest, then connects underneath again in a sweetheart fashion before revealing too much of myself. The bottom of the dress flows down to my ankles and if the wind catches it high enough, reveals a pair of leggings worn underneath. The sleeves of the dress run down my nicely sculpted arms and cover the palms of my hands, only leaving the skin of my fingers showing. I wear dark black boots with gold buckles to match my outfit.</p>
    <p>Personally, I find most people annoying with their antics and stupidity. I have grown accustomed to traveling alone, as most people either fear me at first glance or find my personality too hard to swallow. I value knowledge and have spent the past few years traveling to different cities and towns, and studying topics such as politics, philosophy, mathematics, science, and magic. I pride myself on having a greater understanding of magic and these topics, and will often speak my mind on these subjects, whether asked or not. Socially, I have never gotten along with others, not necessarily due to my control, therefore my responses tend to come out slightly awkward. However, if someone frustrates me enough, I find it easiest to intimidate them to provide me with whatever I currently desire.</p>
    <p>To the obvious eye, my current goal is to gain knowledge on the anomalies that have been occurring recently throughout Avelia. However, at a closer look, there seems to be another secret agenda I am trying to accomplish as well, but will never admit this when asked by others. I also often try to control the chaos that erupts out around me. With the skilled ability to perceive events happening around me quicker than most, and possibly a little magical help, I recognize when something chaotic is about to happen near me, and have a few extra seconds to respond in order to prevent as much chaos as possible. I am able to cast my magic by crushing the materials needed for that particular spell into my hand, whispering chants of arcana, then blowing the dust towards my target which twines into the air and takes the form of whatever spell I casted. Most of my magic revolves around clocks and gears. Currently, I am traveling with a group of six others, all of which frustrate me in their own ways. However, each of them have proven their value to my goals, so I might be sticking around them for a while, at least until I get what I need….</p>
